Analyzing bikesharing data with visual graphs in Tableau

Overview

The purpose of this project is to assist a friend Kate, with creating a bikesharing company in De Moines, Iowa. Following a trip to New York City with Kate and using CitiBike for transportation and to explore the city inspired this idea. This presentation will serve as research and an analysis for an angel investor who make potentially back the company. The following results show data gathered from New York City and will attempt to determine how this company would translate to De Moines, Iowa.

Trip Duration:

Most trips last between 4 and 8 minutes in length of time. This type of travel in very popular for short distances. However, based on the graph, there are still thousands of trips that last over 30 minutes. About 10,000 people have taken trips that lasted up to three hours, so there are certainly people who use CitiBike for longer distances as well.

Trip Duration by Gender:

Users can identify and male, female or unknown when reporting data for CitiBike. Male riders were a significantly higher proportion of bikesharing users than female or unknown. However, all gender types remained fairly consistent with the length of their rides, with a significant spike shown between the 4–8-minute mark.

Weekday Trips:

Based on this heatmap graph, it is clearly shown that trips are far more commonly done during rush hour from Monday to Friday. There is an increase in rides on most weekdays from 7am to 9 am and again from 5pm to 6pm. One observation to note is the low number of rides on Wednesday afternoon during rush hour. Saturdays and Sundays show a much more consistent amount of usage during sunlight hours.

Weekday Trips by Gender:

The patterns of usage for days of the week remained the same between male and female riders. We see the same peaks during the rush hours during the work week and the same consistent ride demand during sunlight hours on the weekend.

User Trips by Gender by Weekday:

The highest number of users are male riders who are subscribed to the bikesharing program. Self-reported unknown customers did have an increase in rides during the weekend. From this we can determine that one time customers are more likely to use the bikes during the weekend, and customers are more likely to report themselves as “unknown” if they are not subscribed to the program.

Top Starting Locations:

The top starting locations shown on the map are all the bike stations available to start a ride. Lower Manhattan proves to be the most common spot for riders to rent bikes from. Demand for bikes tends to drop off the more north you go. Upper Manhattan and Harlem have the least amount of beginning rides.

The most common times to ride bikes are during sunlight hours, with noticeable spikes in demand during morning and afternoon rush hours. The most common time to ride is around 6pm. The least common time to ride is from 1am to 5am.
